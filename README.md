# Welcome to My Tetris
My Tetris project

## Task
There were no problems except that the word "Game Over" at the end was difficult to pronounce and use. Even if a player loses, the game continues. I made it work by writing code in Javascript. And it worked.

## Description
Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov. 
The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow.[3] He derived its name from combining the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (the falling pieces contain 4 segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport. 
The name is also used in-game to refer to the play where four lines are cleared at once.

## Installation
In this Tetris project, I didn't install anything. I only coded in HTML CSS and JS

## Usage
I coded the look of my Tetris project in CSS and HTML. I wrote code in JS that terminates the game operation.
```
./My_Tetris 
```
